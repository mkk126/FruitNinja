Small Unity prototype built to practice gameplay scripting and VR interaction.

- Spawns fruit at intervals with random selection and randomized spawn orientation.
- Tracks time remaining and ends the session when the timer reaches 0.
- Awards points when fruit is hit.
- Basic item destruction on chopping fruits
- SteamVR controller script reads grip/squeeze and allows basic object interaction.

## Notes / TODO
- General cleanup for name tags
- Spawning script showing nonintended behavior due to a math issue
